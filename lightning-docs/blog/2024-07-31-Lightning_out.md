I am excited to announce that Lightning is finally out! After a year of hard work and dedication, Lightning is now available for everyone. I‚Äôve put in countless hours to bring you a powerful and versatile tool, and i can't wait for you to start using it.

I want to thank my team, ``ITESM1``, for giving me the opportunity to test and create ``Lightning``. I also want to extend my gratitude to my great friend [Kevin Giovanni de Le√≥n P√©rez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevindeleon97/) for teaching me VEX programming during my freshman years, and to [Leticia Siller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leticia-siller-a0a14428a/) for helping me with the Lightning artwork.

A special thanks goes to the VEX community, and especially to the development teams behind  [EZ-Template](https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/) , [JAR Template](https://jacksonarearobotics.github.io/JAR-Template/), [ryanlib](https://github.com/Ryan4253/ryanlib/tree/main), [Okapilib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib), [Lemlib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/tree/master) for providing incredible VEX open source projects that served as invaluable resources.

##  Lightning
``Lightning`` is an easy and powerful PROS template that users can use to program more advanced autonomous routines using PID controllers, multitasking, drive train functions, odometry, motion profiles, pure pursuit, etc.

The template was initially created for [ITESM Teams](https://www.instagram.com/tec_robotics/) and was inspired by other incredible templates such as:

* [EZ-template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template?tab=readme-ov-file)
* [JAR-template](https://github.com/JacksonAreaRobotics/JAR-Template)
* [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib)
* [LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/blob/master/README.md?plain=1)
* [ryanlib](https://github.com/Ryan4253/ryanlib)

With this project, I had the opportunity to learn different topics related to programming and software development.

This project could not exist without the support of the VEX community. I hope this library can help many programmers around! üòâ
