During the last month, I have been uploading lightning tutorials on my Youtube channel. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2JI5_sda7eE?si=fNyVJdByYOnhB5qe" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

In this brand-new series, I will show you the lightning fundamentals,installation, upgrading,tutorials, and tips.  

The objetive of this Youtube series is to provide a more dynamic resource. However, It is recommended to complement the video tutorials with the written documentation. 

Additionally, I recommend you to check it out my [Youtube Channel](https://youtube.com/@alonsoibarrahector8773?si=tVnZo6VtZinRvJFV). I usually upload VEX tutorials outside of the Lightning tutorials.
