## Installing PROS
:::note
Lightning works with **PROS 4** and futher.

>PROS is Open Source C/C++ Development for VEX V5 and VEX Cortex made by SIGBots.

Basically, with PROS,we can program the V5 brain and make our robot work. While Lightning it built with PROS, 
you still need to have PROS installed. 

Don´t have PROS installed? Don´t worry! you can find how to install it on the [Getting Started](https://pros.cs.purdue.edu/v5/getting-started/index.html) page of the PROS documentation site.

## Download Lightning
Once you have installed PROS it is time to install Lightning. Check the last releases of the project [here](https://github.com/HectorAlonso18/Lightninglib). 

Then, install the last version of ```lightninglib_example_project-x.x.x.zip```.

:::note
```lightninglib_example_project-x.x.x.zip``` it is different to ```lightninglib@x.x.x.zip```.
