# Lightning
[![License: MPL 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL%202.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0)

**Lightning** is an easy and powerful **PROS** template that users can use to program more advanced autonomous routines using PID controllers, multitasking, drive train functions, odometry, motion profiles, pure pursuit, etc.

The template was initially created for [ITESM Teams](https://www.instagram.com/tec_robotics/) and was inspired by other incredible templates such as:

* [EZ-template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template?tab=readme-ov-file)
* [JAR-template](https://github.com/JacksonAreaRobotics/JAR-Template)
* [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib)
* [LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/blob/master/README.md?plain=1)
* [ryanlib](https://github.com/Ryan4253/ryanlib)

In the following YouTube videos, you can appreciate the results of using Lightning in both testing and competition scenarios. 

* **Pure Pursuit testing**
