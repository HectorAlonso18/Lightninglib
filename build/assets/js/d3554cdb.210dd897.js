I also want to extend my gratitude to my great friend [Kevin Giovanni de Le\xf3n P\xe9rez](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kevindeleon97/) for teaching me VEX programming during my freshman years, and to [Leticia Siller](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leticia-siller-a0a14428a/) for helping me with the Lightning artwork.\\r\\n\\r\\nA special thanks goes to the VEX community, and especially to the development teams behind  [EZ-Template](https://ez-robotics.github.io/EZ-Template/) , [JAR Template](https://jacksonarearobotics.github.io/JAR-Template/), [ryanlib](https://github.com/Ryan4253/ryanlib/tree/main), [Okapilib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib), [Lemlib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/tree/master) for providing incredible VEX open source projects that served as invaluable resources.\\r\\n\\r\\n![Lightning-social-card](/img/Lightning_social_card.png)\\r\\n\\r\\n##  Lightning\\r\\n``Lightning`` is an easy and powerful PROS template that users can use to program more advanced autonomous routines using PID controllers, multitasking, drive train functions, odometry, motion profiles, pure pursuit, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe template was initially created for [ITESM Teams](https://www.instagram.com/tec_robotics/) and was inspired by other incredible templates such as:\\r\\n\\r\\n* [EZ-template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template?tab=readme-ov-file)\\r\\n* [JAR-template](https://github.com/JacksonAreaRobotics/JAR-Template)\\r\\n* [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib)\\r\\n* [LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/blob/master/README.md?plain=1)\\r\\n* [ryanlib](https://github.com/Ryan4253/ryanlib)\\r\\n\\r\\nWith this project, I had the opportunity to learn different topics related to programming and software development.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis project could not exist without the support of the VEX community. I hope this library can help many programmers around! \ud83d\ude09\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n## Features\\r\\n* TankDrive support.\\r\\n* Odometry class\\r\\n* Generic PID class.\\r\\n* Generic FeedForward class.\\r\\n* Pure pursuit.\\r\\n* Path planning and Motion profile. \\r\\n* Multitasking. \\r\\n* Different Math functions. \\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Python utilities \ud83d\udc0d\\r\\n``Lightning`` has different python utilities to maximize the user experience.\\r\\n\\r\\n* LightningPlanner: Plan your autonomous routes without the necessity of physical measurements.  \\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n\\r\\n## Lightning Demostration\\r\\nIn the following YouTube videos, you can appreciate the results of using Lightning in both testing and competition scenarios. \\r\\n\\r\\n* [Pure Pursuit testing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6EuZdJf89HI)\\r\\n* [Trapezoidal Profile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZaXgi8o368)\\r\\n* [ITESM1 OVER UNDER Worlds Autonomous Routine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hosBW9l6dMY)\\r\\n* [ITESM1 OVER UNDER Worlds Q-F autonomous](https://youtu.be/sDA6RqO024Y)\\r\\n* [ITESM1 OVER UNDER Worlds QUAL autonomous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LpFiJdZ04_4)\\r\\n\\r\\n---\\r\\n## Future work\\r\\nWe working to introduce more features to lightning! and also creating the documentation page where you could see all the documentation that you need to use lightning. \\r\\n\\r\\n---"},{"id":"welcome","metadata":{"permalink":"/Lightninglib/blog/welcome","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2024-07-30-welcome/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2024-07-30-welcome/index.md","title":"Welcome","description":"Welcome to the official Lightning blog.
