### How it works
1. **Generate Waypoints:** Click to set waypoints for your robot's path.

2. **Print Coordinates:** Right-click to view all the coordinates you‚Äôve generated.
```console
Origin: x: 0 (inches)  y:  0 (inches)
x: 2.59 (inches)  y: 28.18 (inches)
x: -42.40 (inches)  y: 49.90 (inches)
x: -91.78 (inches)  y: 51.19 (inches)
X:  [185.0, 11.0, -180.0]
Y:  [-88.0, -4.0, 1.0]
```

3. **Save Coordinates:** Press 's' to save the waypoints to a text file in the Field_waypoints directory.
```txt
X: {185.0, 11.0, -180.0}
Y: {-88.0, -4.0, 1.0}
```
You can paste this new coordinates to your `Lightning project` and construct a new Path using the `Path` class. 

```cpp
lightning::Path my_path({185.0, 11.0, -180.0},{-88.0, -4.0, 1.0},false,3)
```

4. **Reset:** Press 'r' to reset the coordinates and start planning from scratch.

5. **Exit:** Press 'q' to exit the program
