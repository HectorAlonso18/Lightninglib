# Lightning üå©Ô∏è
Lightning is an easy and powerful PROS template that users can use to program more advanced autonomous routines using PID controllers, multitasking, drive train functions, odometry, motion profiles, pure pursuit, etc.

The template was initially created for [ITESM Teams](https://www.instagram.com/tec_robotics/) and was inspired by other incredible templates such as:

* [EZ-template](https://github.com/EZ-Robotics/EZ-Template?tab=readme-ov-file)
* [JAR-template](https://github.com/JacksonAreaRobotics/JAR-Template)
* [OkapiLib](https://github.com/OkapiLib/OkapiLib)
* [LemLib](https://github.com/LemLib/LemLib/blob/master/README.md?plain=1)
* [ryanlib](https://github.com/Ryan4253/ryanlib)

With this project, I had the opportunity to learn different topics related to programming and software development.

This project could not exist without the support of the VEX community. I hope this library can help many programmers around! üòâ
